A bot that posts Wednesday memes, my dudes.

Set a posting schedule and a channel to post in, and choose from one of three modes:
* Classic Wednesday frog
* Text only
* Variety

You can submit your own memes for variety mode using `@WednesdayBot submit <url>`. If your server's meme queue is empty, WednesdayBot will select one from the global queue, which is curated by our team of Wednesday enthusiasts.
